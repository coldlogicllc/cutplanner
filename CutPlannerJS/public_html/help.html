        <ol>
            <li>Select a plan you wish to view in the top left corner drop-down menu. By default the "current plan" will be selected and will have a check next to its name.</li>
            <li>To add/remove plans click the Add/Remove buttons next to the plans drop down menu. For adding new plans you will be prompted to enter a name. The default plan name is current user_date.</li>
            <li>Once a plan is selected, you can change plan information. New plans will be a clone of the current plan. It is recommended that users create a new plan instead of making changes to the current.</li>
            <li>The grid displays groups of "buckets" which are a collection of manus scheduled to be cut. From here you have the option of changing the number of hours or workers for that day. Changes will not be committed until "Compute New Schedule" button is pressed.</li>
            <li>Below the day grid you can view a list of groups (a collection of boxes from the grid). These are color coded to match.</li>
            <li>If you change the target date or workers/hours you will need to "Compute New Schedule" by clicking the blue button up top. It will be disabled until one of these fields is changed. Unsaved changes will appear in blue.</li>
            <li>Once you are satisfied with your changes to target date, hours or workers, click "Compute New Schedule".</li>
            <li>If you wish to reset changes you can also click the "reset" button up top.</li>
            <li>Name, color and promised date will save automatically since no action is required to calculate a new plan.</li>
            <li>Once you are satisfied with a plan, you can set it as the current plan (overriding existing plan) by clicking the orange "Set as Current" button.</li>
        </ol>
